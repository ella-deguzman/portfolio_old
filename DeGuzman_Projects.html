            <h1>Project 1.2.5: Winch Creation, POE </h1>
            <h6> October 17, 2018 - October 24, 2018 </h6>
            <p>Our goal of this project was to make an electrical winch system and a simulation of the system using the program, NetLogo. We wanted to make the electrical winch system that was able to carry the most weight with the most efficiency. We also wanted the simulation to show the effect of the drum size on linear speed, have a slider for voltage, and show the effect of voltage on speed. During the project, my main role was to created the winch simulation. I created the adjustable sliders for drum size, angular speed, voltage, and mass of the weight that the electrical winch would lift. I also wrote the code to make program respond to changes in the drum size and voltage. Throughout the duration of the project, I learned how to implement the code that we learned in class to make my visualization of the program come to real life, onto my screen. This was the most challenging part of the project, because there were times when my code would not follow my desired outcome. Sometimes, I felt like giving up because everything I tried would not work, but I persisted and eventually figured it out. This helped me learn how to be specific with my code because the smallest typo can make your whole program not work. The project also taught me how to work well with my team and manage our time. All of us split the work evenly and finished all the work before our deadline!  </p>

            <h1>Project 2.3.2: West Point Bridge Designer, POE </h1>
            <h6> March 8, 2019 - March 21, 2019 </h6>
            <p>Our goal of this project was to create a final bridge design under three hundred thousand dollars, using the West Point Bridge Designer software. We wanted to make a bridge that was able to withstand the weight of a truck, with the the least amount of tension and compression at each beam. My partner and I had to make two bridge ideas separately and then create a final design by modifying the best bridge. During the project, my main role was to make modifications to our brainstorm ideas to design a final bridge that was efficient and cost effective. To do this, I created a decision matrix, based on sturdiness, cost, aesthetics, and environmental impact,  which helped us pick a base, for our bridge. I made the chosen design have thicker and stronger beams, at the areas with the most compression and tension. I also reduced the size of the beams that were least affected by tension and compression in order to keep the cost low. All these modifications allowed me to create a bridge that was not only cheap and sturdy, but also aesthetically pleasing. Throughout the duration of the project, I learned how to use the West Point Bridge Designer software to create a variety of bridges, with arch abutments, piers, and deck elevations. Coming up with the final design was the most challenging part of the project, because there were times when my bridge would be sturdy, but too expensive. Finding a perfect balance between bridge stability and the cost limit was time consuming, but luckily I planned my time effectively. The project taught me how useful it is to use simulations to envision how my ideas will work in the real world. </p>

      <h1> Field Trips </h1> 
        <p> The Cal Maritime Academy and the Sun Power field trip was my favorite field trip that we went on this year. At Cal Maritime, we got a tour of the campus and we learned how students at the school are prepared differently than others. For example, students at the school are required to spend a semester at sea where they will apply their knowledge of steering a boat to get to a specified location. I thought this was such a unique opportunity that the students have, since they get hands on experience for their future careers. In addition, we went to Sun Power where we toured their office and learned about the workers' roles. I enjoyed learning about how much power could come from an inexhaustible energy source, the sun, and how environmentally friendly solar panels are. The field trip inspired me to apply for AP Environmental Science next year, so that I can learn more about our environment. I know how polluted our Earth is and I would like to make my entrepreneurship project on a way to improve the environment. </p>
      <h1> Guest Speaker </h1>
        <p> My favorite guest speaker was when Maynard Holiday came to our class. He talked about the different robots that are being created in order to help companies with difficult tasks. For example, in Chernobyl a reactor exploded and lost control of coolants. Unfortunately, this created lots of radiation in the atmosphere. This caused Maynard Holiday and his company to build a robot to detect when a reaction will occur in the basement. Although creating robots is difficult, it allows tasks to be completed without a human risking their life in a dangerous situation. This guest speaker was the most interesting because he showed us videos of different robots that were created. All the robots inspired me, because it proves how endless the possibilities are with engineering!</p>

            <h1> Who am I? </h1>
            <p> Everyone has goals that they want to accomplish. During my life, I would love to pursue a job in the engineering field. My interest for engineering started when my dad would take me to his work whenever I had no school. I always thought it was fascinating how engineering allows people to use their ideas and apply it to technology to increase productivity and benefit users. At first, I was interested in a career with biomedical engineering. I love working with technology as well as helping others out, so I thought that this job would be a great combination for both of my interests. I applied to the biomedical academy at our school to explore my interest in the biomedical field. Unfortunately I was not accepted, but that did not stop me from applying to the engineering academy for my Sophomore year. I was extremely excited when I got accepted and I found a love for engineering through my Principles of Engineering class. From working with a team to coding to creating robots, this class taught me about basic skills needed for different fields of engineering. After sophomore year I decided to join an internship at my dad's work, Big Switch, where I was able to learn how to assemble raspberry pis, use BitBucket, use GitHub, code using Markdown, and much more. All of these experiences led me to become interested in pursuing a job involved in computer science. I am not sure what specific job I would like to choose, but I would like my job to be centered around engineering and be related to either biology, environmental science, or business development.  To achieve this goal, I intend on being in the engineering academy from sophomore to junior year at Dublin High. I am also taking environmental science to explore my passion for helping the world become a better place for future generations. I also aim on getting a Computer Science bachelors degree, at a college, in the future. Having all this background knowledge in engineering could help me become closer to reaching my goal. </p>

            <p> There are lots of traits that everyone has that makes them unique. One main trait that I have is that I am a very dedicated person. If I have a goal that I set my mind to, I will dedicate lots of time to do so. For example, one of my goals of Freshman year was to make it into the lacrosse team. To accomplish this goal, I practiced everyday and I attended a lot of the conditionings. It was a lot of hard work but within a month, I already knew a lot of the skills. When tryouts came, I felt very prepared and I made it onto the team. Having lots of dedication can benefit me in a career in engineering, because if I am given goals, I will put in all my work to accomplish it. I am also very optimistic. For instance, recently, I received a bad grade on my Musical Theatre class. Even though I didn't receive the grade that I thought I deserved, I had a positive mindset. Instead of thinking “I can’t do this,” I believed that “this will push me to do harder next time.” I surprisingly improved in acting and singing, because I had a positive mindset. Being optimistic is a trait that can help me with engineering because instead of giving up, I will try my hardest to improve myself. </p>
            <br>
            <p>One of my major accomplishments was creating my own club with my friends this year. We created STAR club for Dublin High, which is a community service club. I wanted to create this club because I have a huge passion for helping others. Every week I am working harder and harder to improve the club and I can't wait to see how the club grows. Another accomplishment was making it into the golf team this year and last year. Just like lacrosse, I never played golf before. I was so determined to make it on the team, so I practiced with my brother during the summer. When I tried out and I was so surprised when my coach told me that I made it on the Junior Varsity team. Through these situations, I learned that I am very committed and I can manage my time well. </p>  
            <br>
            </p> My experiences have definitely shaped me to become the person I am today and I have learned so much about my interests and abilities. Thank you for taking your time to learn about me. Feel free to explore the rest of my site to see the past projects and accomplishments I have done!</p>
